# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup Guide

Since we have the code ready and committed locally, here are the steps to create and push to GitHub:

### 1. Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "New repository" (green button)
3. Repository name: `new-era-ai-invoicing-system`
4. Description: `Professional invoicing system for automated client billing with NestJS backend and Next.js frontend`
5. Set to **Public** (or Private if preferred)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Existing Code
After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see a page with setup instructions. Use the "push an existing repository" commands:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\simon\New Era AI\Clients + Projects\Invoicing System"
git branch -M main
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/new-era-ai-invoicing-system.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### 3. Verify Upload
- Check that all files are visible on GitHub
- Verify the README.md displays properly
- Confirm the commit message shows correctly

## Repository Structure
```

├── infrastructure/    # Docker configurations
├── README.md          # Project overview
├── DEVELOPMENT.md     # Development guide
└── docker-compose.yml # Development environment
```

## Next Steps After Push
1. Set up GitHub Actions (optional)
2. Configure branch protection rules
3. Add collaborators if needed
4. Set up issue templates
5. Configure project settings

## Current Status
✅ Git repository initialized  
✅ All files committed locally  
✅ Remote origin configured (needs URL update)  
⏳ Waiting for GitHub repository creation  
⏳ Ready to push to GitHub

The code is ready to be pushed as soon as the GitHub repository is created!
